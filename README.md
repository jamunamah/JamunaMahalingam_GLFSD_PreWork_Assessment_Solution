This is the solution to the following question.

Question:

Write a program that performs multiple operations:

 

Check for palindrome number
Prints the pattern of stars in decreasing order based on the input
Check whether the input number is a prime number
Print Fibonacci series of size n with first two numbers as 0, 1
 

Using Switch case and do-While loop provide all the above functionality, such that the user can select the functions that he/she needs to perform and exit the program based on the input.

Function Explanations in Brief: 

1) Palindrome number:

 The numbers which give the same value when reversed are called palindrome numbers.

Example: 121, 12321, 512215, etc.,

 

2)Pattern of stars: 

 

Based on the input integer, the levels in the pattern and the number of stars in each level are decided. At every level, the number of stars is 1 less than the previous level.

 

Example: If the input number is 4, then the output will be

****

***

**

*

 

 if input no is 5, then the output will be

*****

****

***

**

*




If input no is 2, then the output will be

 

**

*

 

3) Prime number: 

 

The numbers which are only divisible by 1 & themselves are called prime numbers. 

(Or) 

The numbers which have factors as 1 and themselves are called prime numbers.

 

Example_1: If the input number is 23

Factors of 23 are 1, 23, and other than 1 it  is divisible by 23 only

Hence the number is prime.

 

Example_2: If the input number is 22

Factors of 22 are 1,2, 11, 22 and are divisible by 2 and 11.

Hence the number is not a prime number.

 

 4)Fibonacci series: 

The series of numbers whose next number is the sum of its previous two numbers is called the Fibonacci series.

Example_1: If the input number is 5,

The Fibonacci series  is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 (by default first two numbers are 0,1 (hardcoded), and we need to calculate the other nos in series)

 

Example_2: If the input number is 7

The Fibonacci series is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 , 8

 

Exit:

The program should ask the user to choose the task they want to perform after executing a task, till choice 0 is entered to exit the program.
